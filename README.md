# ECS3

Back to the drawing board.

One more time back to scratch, building simple game interactions from the ground up using pick-n-choose stuff from the Love2d/Lua community (Tiled maps, debug console etc.)

Instead of jumping off of the crozeng/modules/ECS stuff I built in elwens_animals, starting over from scratch trying:

- Entity as a Tree
   - Entity contains a list of Component and child entities
- Components as plain-ol-tables
